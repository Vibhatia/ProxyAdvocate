          <p>Proxy Advocates Community, Make your Appearance Effective.</p>
          <p>
            The Proxy Advocates Community as a concept is brought to you as a
            solution for all those instances when the filing Advocate on record,
            practicing in and around the city is unable to reach the court
            proceedings on time due to various reasons, i.e., multiple matters
            listed in various courts at the same time.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            We intend to resolve these circumstantial issues by connecting you
            to a qualified proxy counsel, who would temporarily fill your
            position as the main counsel and handle the situation upon your
            absence at a reasonable rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aspire to build a network that would consist of Senior/Filing
            Counsels as well as Proxy Counsels who would act in the information
            of the Filing Counsel in certain specified matters on his behalf.
            The idea behind the community is foster a collaborative work
            environment for the Senior as well as Junior Advocates.
          </p>{" "}

          proceedings and increases their efficiency by providing them with a
          substitute counsel who would represent the advocate upon their
          absence. <br />• Provides an opportunity for Junior Advocates to
          generate work and establish contacts. Join our community via the link:
